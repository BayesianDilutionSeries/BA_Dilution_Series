# Python implementation of Bayesian Analyses of Dilution Series.
This is the python implementation of Plum. It creates age-depth models using 210Pb data, and the autoregressive gamma process presented in Blaauw and Christen (2011). PyPlum is the full implementation of Aquino-LÃ³pez et al. (2018). This implementation allows users to incorporate 210Pb to longer age-depth models (adding radiocarbon and calendar dates).
